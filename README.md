# Analytics-Stuff

The key themes:

   1. Be experimental and change ready –  be proactive: analytics are changing fast, so you will have to
    
   2. Rethink your information – information is not just a byproduct, it’s an asset
    
   3. Broaden analytical architectures – it’s about much more than traditional structured transaction data
    
   4. Market analytics internally – communication is key
